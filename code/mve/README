Installation notes:

Download and Install a SDP solver
        - download CSDP (https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp/)
        - edit the csdp.m file so that the dos and system calls point to the full
        path of the csdp executable e.g. info=system([csdp ' fname '.dat-s' ' '       
        fname '.sol']); becomes info=system(['/Users/blake/bin/matlab/csdp ' 
        fname '.dat-s' ' ' fname '.sol']);

Download and install MVE
        - downlad and unzip a copy of MVE
        - edit the file setuppath.m to add the directory containing csdp to
        matlab's path
        - in matlab run mvedriver for an example of how to use mve

* To use MVE-full
    - note: MVE requires the YALMIP package
	- download a copy of YALMIP (http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~joloef/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Download)
	- edit the file setuppath.m so that YALMIP is in your path, and yalmip can access CSDP
